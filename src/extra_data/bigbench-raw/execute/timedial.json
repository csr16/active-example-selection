My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, and as a result, my writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used. \nA: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession? \nB: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input. \nA: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description? \nB: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week. Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks, my boss and I stayed until 2 a. m. for two nights before the final wrap up. It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results. My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort. \nA: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome. \nB: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done. \nA: What are your strengths and weaknesses? \nB: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs. As far as weaknesses, I really enjoy my work, and sometimes I put in too much time. But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more. \nA: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss. \nB: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves. I asked her if I could talk with her one day, and we had a good discussion. It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure. I took the time to explain the procedures, and there haven't been any problems since that day. \nA: When do you find a job satisfying? \nB: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job. When I first started as a paralegal, I had a lot to learn. But through hard work, advice from some good mentors and continuing education, I have come a long way. I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner. \nA: How would your coworkers describe you? \nB: First, they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. I really enjoy working with people. Secondly, they'll say I had great customer service skills. I put the customer first. And thirdly, they'll say that I know the law. I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously. \nA: Do you have any questions? \nB: Yes, I do.

But she was open to suggestions, so long as employees could back them up with research and facts. When I submitted my suggestion, she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work. She then took my revised proposal to her boss. He was a more conservative type, but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks. He did, and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change. I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs.

You can even buy a live chicken there if you want.\nB: Live chicken? Thanks, but no thanks. So... tell me about bargaining. How can I do it like a local?\nA: Well. I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person. You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that. But... if you're smart, you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price.\nB: Cool ! Teach me !\nA: For starters, you want to do a lot of scouting first. You've got to know what things cost.\nB: Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs. The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items, you can figure out the relative prices of everything else.\nA: That could be helpful. But when you go into a shopping center... prices become very flexible. You have to be able to read the market. </context> \n <choices> (A) 3 hours . (B) 240 seconds .

But how should you screen potential mates? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail? \nB: I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long.

You need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes. \nA: It's always easier to say something than to do it. \nB: It's not too difficult to make a good impression. For example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications. \nA: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans. \nB: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes. \nA: It's a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes. \nB: You misunderstood me.

This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance.

I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds.
